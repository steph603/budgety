# Budgety

Completed April 2020 as a walkthrough during Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript Course (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)
HTML and CSS were already completed for me, and I just added the Javascript.  

- I would like to improve UX - change green tick 'add item' button to two buttons - Green ^ arrow, and Red v arrow to add either an income or expense.
  
  The current drop down box to select income (+) or expense (-) is awkward, but this was good to include for the sake of learning the 'change' event listener and changing borders from red to green.
  
- There is some awkward code in here!  (itemID = event.target.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.id), I'm sure there is a nicer way of writing this, but this is what we have been taught so far in the course - I would like to come back and edit it when I know a better way!
